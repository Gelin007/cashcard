# Cash Card Application #
In this small project, I've built a simple Family Cash Card application â€” a modern way for parents to manage allowance funds for their kiddos.

I've used Spring Boot to progress from creating a single cash card in a database to allowing for the editing, deleting, and viewing of multiple cash cards, and finally securing my app against unauthorized access and unwanted exploits.
